This is an alpha version of what could become a named entity tagger and linker...

For lazy people, just clone repository and try this:

```cat data/all.txt | python predict.py```

Sorry but don't expect good results for the moment.

This requires quite standard packages installed, such as scikit.

If you'd like to learn a new model, you'll have to:

- have some annotated data
- find a corpus to learn embeddings
